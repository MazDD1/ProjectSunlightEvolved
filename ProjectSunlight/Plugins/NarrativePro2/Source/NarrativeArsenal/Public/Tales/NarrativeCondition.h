/**
 * Narrative Conditions allow you to make conditions that dialogues and quests can then use to conditionally include/exclude nodes.
 * 
 * For example, you could make a condition "HasItem" that checks if the player has a certain amount of an item. Then, you could use that
 * condition on a dialogue node so that the player can only say "I'll buy it!" if they actually have 500 coins in their inventory. 
 * 
 * Currently quests do not support NarrativeConditions, only NarrativeEvents. Dialogues support both.
